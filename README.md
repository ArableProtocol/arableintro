# Arable Introduction

Arable is a farmable synthetic asset generation protocol that brings various chain's growing assets on a single chain.
Users are not needed to cross the bridge for higher APY yield farms but just use a single interface and single chain to farm all chain's assets.
Users can farm Cosmos ecosystem, Polkadot ecosystem, Solana ecosystem, AVAX and all the other chains' assets on Polygon network with Arable.

The crypto services who runs the validator service for staking projects can come to the Arable network and run the yield farming service as well.
