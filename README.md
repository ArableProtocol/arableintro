# Arable Introduction

Arable is a farmable synthetic assets issurance protocol to bring various chain's growing assets on a single chain.
Users are not needed to cross the bridge for higher APY yield farms but just use a single interface and single chain to farm all chain's assets.
Users can farm Cosmos, Polkadot, Solana ecosystem, Polygon, AVAX and all the other chains' assets on Avalanche network with Arable.

The collateral providers (aka. minters or stakers) are counterparties of the farming and exchange.

Protocol's goal is to provide optimized on-chain UX for yield farmers.
