# Arable Introduction

Arable is the first decentralized synthetic farming protocol to bring multiple chains' assets and yield farms on a single chain.
Users are not needed to cross the bridge for higher APY yield farms but just use a single interface and single chain to farm all chain's assets.
Users can farm Cosmos, Polkadot, Solana ecosystem, Polygon, AVAX and all the other chains' assets on Avalanche network with Arable.

The collateral providers (aka. minters) are counterparties of the farming and swap operations.

Protocol's goal is to provide optimized on-chain UX for yield farmers.
